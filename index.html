                        This talk is about inclusive e-assessment.
                        It's not something I'm an expert in but
                        it's something I care about.
                        I'm going to draw from my own reading on the subject
                        and my experiences designing e-assessment to give you some ideas for
                        ways you can improve your assessments.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        First of all these slides are done in a
                        nice colourful handwritten style which I
                        enjoy, but there are captions on the
                        video version and a transcribed version
                        on the conference website.
                    </p>
                </aside>
                <img src="inclusive-e-assessment-2.png" alt="Or, who are you not designing for?">
                <aside>
                    <p>
                        This talk could have been called "who are you <em>not</em> designing this for?".
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        The problem is that
                        it's easy to imagine a student just like
                        you while you're designing any
                        assessment and anybody else who is different because they have particular
                        requirements or just come from a
                        different background, you might have to
                        make some effort to adapt to them.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        That's called the deficit model.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        Another way of doing things is to think about all of your students before you implement your
                        e-assessment and design for <em>everybody</em>.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        The best outcome of inclusive design is
                        that when an issue arises and you need
                        to make an accommodation for a student
                        you can say 'well, this student is already
                        catered for'.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        Now,  I'm a privately educated
                        straight white British male so many of
                        the things I'm going to talk about I've
                        heard about secondhand, to be honest, so
                        the things I'm going to talk about are
                        from my perspective.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        You might do things
                        differently but the idea that you should
                        be thinking about other people than
                        yourself hopefully is transferable.
                    </p>
                </aside>
                <img src="inclusive-e-assessment-3.png" alt="Three boxes headed 'Subjectivity', 'Accessibility' and 'Integrity'">
                <aside>
                    <p>
                        I've come up with three kinds of barriers 
                        to inclusion.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        First, subjectivity: these are
                        largely cultural aspects that might make
                        students feel alienated or mean that
                        there's something that they don't know
                        that you assume they know that would
                        stop them engaging with the assessment.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        Then, accessibility: this is largely
                        barriers to individuals: reasons a
                        particular person can't access your
                        e-assessment.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        And finally, integrity: these
                        are the sort of things that you do to
                        make your job easier but which might
                        make students' lives harder or make them
                        perform worse than they should
                        relative to other students.
                    </p>
                </aside>
                <img src="inclusive-e-assessment-4.png" alt="Subjectivity - who is the subject of your assessment?">
                <aside>
                    <p>
                        Subjectivity: this is a term I first
                        encountered in Sara Hottinger's book
                        <em><a href="https://www.sunypress.edu/p-6186-inventing-the-mathematician.aspx">Inventing the mathematician</a></em> and the idea
                        is it's about the question, "does the student believe
                        that they are the subject of your
                        assessment?" Sara Hottinger's book gives
                        many examples of questions which either
                        support stereotypes or have a very
                        restricted perspective.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        For example, questions where a female character is always a
                        helper or a male character is allowed to
                        make mistakes, and Eurocentrism in what
                        kind of maths is covered.
                    </p>
                </aside>
                <img src="inclusive-e-assessment-5.png" alt="Consider: gender (names, pronouns); ethnicity; culture (references, common knowledge); class (amounts of money, activities); geography; family">
                <aside>
                    <p>
                        Things to consider: first of all gender and
                        ethnicity are really about who you
                        portray in your question prompts.
                        Try to avoid it always being men, try to avoid
                        it always being people from the same
                        part of the world as you.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        Something that's not as obvious is names of people.
                        It's quite hard to think of names that
                        aren't from the same sort of
                        background as you and even when you
                        don't have named characters make sure
                        you use a sensible mix of pronouns - just
                        picking at random is a good way to do it.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        Culture can be a barrier: if you use
                        references to TV shows or films that
                        students haven't seen then they might
                        miss something.
                        You might think it's fun
                        to set a question about Game of
                        Thrones but if the students don't get the
                        references that might make it a little bit
                        harder for them, or there might be a
                        really good reason why that student
                        doesn't watch Game of Thrones.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        Be aware of relying on common knowledge: for
                        example, the fact that there are 11
                        players on a football team.
                        Don't assume the students know this.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        In the UK we have
                        a national speed limit sign which has no
                        numbers on it and whose meaning depends
                        on exactly where you are so don't assume
                        the students will know what that means.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        Now these cultural aspects and these
                        knowledge aspects quite often go along
                        with class, so for example a question all
                        about a skiing holiday that begins
                        "Sarah spends X thousand pounds on her skiing
                        holiday..." - I have no idea how much one
                        would spend on a skiing holiday - and that
                        can make students feel alienated, like
                        they're not the same kind of people that
                        you're expecting to be in this class.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        Geography: there's a couple of things
                        here.
                        Think about where things
                        typically happen.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        Here in Newcastle I've
                        often caught lecturers setting big
                        mistakes happening in Sunderland, which
                        is nearby and which we have a big rivalry with.
                        We have students from Sunderland so I'm
                        sure they don't feel great about reading
                        questions about that.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        Make sure that
                        there aren't certain countries that you
                        only ever refer to as holiday
                        destinations or as places that people who
                        need help come from.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        And finally family not everybody comes
                        from a classic atomic family of a mum
                        and a dad and kids so try and vary the
                        inter-personal relationships that you portray in your
                        questions and where possible use
                        statistics to make representative
                        choices of all of these aspects.
                    </p>
                </aside>
                <img src="inclusive-e-assessment-6.png" alt="Accessibility - what are you assessing?">
                <aside>
                    <p>
                        Accessibility: think about what you're
                        assessing.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        Are you assessing whether the
                        student knows how to plot a graph or are
                        you assessing if they can use your
                        plotting tool? 
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        Often when accessibility
                        comes up it's to do with physical
                        disabilities, to do with the way the
                        student interacts with your
                        e-assessment system but you also need to
                        consider non-physical disabilities that
                        might affect how a student processes the
                        information you're giving them or their
                        ability to engage with the content.

                    <p>
                        So the first thing pretty much everybody
                        thinks of for accessibility is 'can
                        you use a screen reader?' 
                        Every system should be usable with a screen reader
                        and that also often means usable with
                        just a keyboard, not a mouse or a
                        touchscreen.
                        So that's well covered.

                    <p>
                        It's easy to forget about things like colours:
                        never just use colour to convey
                        information.
                        This is something I'm
                        always on top of because I'm very colourblind
                        and contrast is important: people
                        with visual impairments where they need
                        a very strong contrast between colours.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        Firefox has a very good accessibility
                        inspector you can use to check that
                        you're coping with that.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        In the text of your questions use as simple
                        language as possible when you tell the
                        student what to do or when you give them
                        information: it makes it less likely that
                        they'll misinterpret.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        In your instructions be as clear as you possibly
                        can about what you want the student to
                        do without giving away a method that you
                        might want them to recall on their own.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        Everybody's bad at reading instructions.
                        And don't rely on conventions because
                        for example don't use the word 'simplify' for an
                        expression because that's very
                        ambiguous.
                    </p>

                    <p>

                        When you have images make sure
                        you give alt text for them so it's read
                        out by screen readers or assistive
                        technology, when you have videos make
                        sure that there are captions, and when
                        you have audio make sure it's
                        transcribed as well.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        Think about what
                        you're requiring in terms of motor
                        skills from the student.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        For some peoplejust using a mouse is a massive effort
                        so just clicking on things repeatedly
                        is going to take much longer than
                        other students.
                        And try to offer multiple
                        input methods for any interaction, for
                        example for a drag-and-drop activity
                        allow a mouse of course but make sure a
                        student can also use the keyboard to
                        rearrange the items.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        In general be very
                        careful when you have a new interaction
                        type: built in input methods for most
                        systems can be relied upon because the
                        developers have done work on
                        accessibility but things like
                        interactive graphics, embedded tools from
                        outside the system, you need to think
                        about 'can every student use this interaction?'

                        Finally, integrity: this is about the
                        things that you do to protect the
                        integrity of the assessment, make sure
                        it's fair.

                        My slogan here is "one cheater
                        is less of a problem than a hundred
                        students giving up".
                        Things that you do to make sure that an assessment is fair
                        could affect some students more than others.

                <img src="inclusive-e-assessment-9.png" alt="Strict rules cause problems - let students change their minds. Instructions should help, not constrain - accept every reasonable answer. Limits add pressue - time limit, submission counts.">

                    <p>
                        Strict rules cause problems.
                        For example
                        if you limit when an assessment is
                        available, are all of your students sure
                        to be free at that time? What if their
                        internet breaks and it's a very
                        restricted time period.
                        If you give longer for students to access something
                        then it's more likely they'd be able to
                        complete it.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        You might need to tell the
                        student to enter their answer in a
                        certain way because of a limitation of
                        the system itself.
                        For example you might
                        need them to use a particular letter for
                        their constant of integration - that's
                        your problem not theirs.
                        Certainly tell
                        them what they need to do but if the
                        student enters an answer that would be
                        reasonable make every effort to accept
                        it.
                        Try to minimize the times that you
                        have to give students this sort of
                        instruction.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        Limits add
                        pressure.
                        If a student only has a certain
                        amount of time in which to complete an
                        assessment, some people respond better to
                        that than others.
                        If there's a limit on
                        how many times a student can submit an
                        answer that can cause problems, for
                        example if a student just submits an
                        answer by mistake.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        Finally, if you want to limit how the
                        student navigates through an exam, for
                        example they can't go back to a question
                        they've already answered, that promotes
                        bad exam technique.
                        Really you should
                        always allow a student to go back and
                        change their answer.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        So that's just about it.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        Again, I'm not an expert on these
                        sorts of things.
